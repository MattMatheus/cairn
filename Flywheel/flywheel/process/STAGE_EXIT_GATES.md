# Stage Exit Gates

## Planning Exit
- intake artifacts are created or updated
- scope, constraints, assumptions, and risks are explicit
- next-stage recommendation is explicit
- if optional artifact workflow is enabled, a durable handoff manifest is created when useful

## Architect Exit
- decision output is concrete and reviewable
- alternatives, tradeoffs, and operational impact are explicit
- follow-on implementation paths are explicit when needed
- story moves to architecture QA

## Engineering Exit
- acceptance criteria implementation is complete
- required validation has run
- handoff includes validation evidence, open risks, and QA focus areas
- story moves to engineering QA

## QA Exit
- verdict is explicit
- missing evidence is treated as a blocking QA issue
- bugs are filed when needed
- story moves to `done` or back to `active`

## Cycle Closure
- observer report is written
- observer report records validation, risks, and action/approval context
- queue state is synchronized
- one cycle commit is created
- if optional artifact workflow is enabled, a cycle-closure manifest is created when useful
